## A Moment on the Wonen's Rugby Bandwagon

I just watched the Bristol Bears play the Leicester Tigers in Premiership Rugby, England's top division of rugby. 
I'm still getting the hang of the game, but it was a great game. 

I looked at the Bristol Bears [roster](https://www.bristolbearsrugby.com/teams/womens-first-team/)
to remind myself who the player of the game was (Holly Phillips), and noticed that
they have three Hollys on the team (OK, one is a Hollie).
As a Holly born in the 
[Holly heydey](https://engaging-data.com/baby-name-visualizer/?n=holl&sex=f&data=n),
that's really surprising.
Sure, I was on a sports team with three other Hollys, but there are only 20% as many
Hollys now as there were back them.
